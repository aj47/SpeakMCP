# Summary of Changes - Enhanced LLM Debugging & Gemini Fix

## Problem
The `google/gemini-2.5-flash` model was failing with repeated "Previous request had invalid response" errors, causing an infinite retry loop. The issue was that the model doesn't support JSON Schema structured output when accessed through OpenRouter.

## Solution

### 1. Auto-Detection of Model Capabilities (NEW!)
The system now **automatically learns** which models support structured output and remembers this for future requests. No need to hardcode every incompatible model!

**How it works:**
- First request with a new model: Tries JSON Schema, records success/failure
- Subsequent requests: Uses cached knowledge to skip incompatible modes
- Cache expires after 24 hours to adapt to provider changes

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Works with any new model automatically
- ‚úÖ Adapts to provider changes
- ‚úÖ Optimal performance after first request
- ‚úÖ Low maintenance

See `AUTO_DETECTION_GUIDE.md` for full details.

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging (11 new debug points)
Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the LLM request/response pipeline to help diagnose issues:

- **HTTP Error Response Logging** - Shows full error details when requests fail
- **HTTP Success Response Logging** - Shows response structure when requests succeed  
- **Structured Output Error Detection** - Identifies when models don't support JSON schema
- **Response Structure Logging** - Shows the complete API response structure
- **Content Extraction Details** - Logs what content was extracted and its type
- **JSON Extraction Results** - Shows whether JSON was successfully parsed
- **Fallback Mode Tracking** - Tracks JSON Schema ‚Üí JSON Object ‚Üí Plain Text fallbacks
- **Empty Response Detection** - Detailed logging when responses are empty
- **Agent Mode Invalid Response Details** - Full details when validation fails
- **Call Attempt Tracking** - Logs each LLM call with provider info
- **Return Value Logging** - Shows what's being returned from each function

### 3. Fixed Gemini Model Support
Added `google/gemini` to the hardcoded list of models incompatible with JSON Schema structured output:

**File:** `src/main/llm-fetch.ts`
**Function:** `isKnownIncompatibleWithStructuredOutput()`

```typescript
const incompatibleModels: string[] = [
  // Google Gemini models through OpenRouter don't support JSON schema
  // They return empty or invalid responses when json_schema is requested
  "google/gemini",
]
```

This ensures Gemini models skip JSON Schema mode and use JSON Object or plain text mode instead.

**Note:** With the new auto-detection feature, this hardcoded list is now just a "seed" - the system will automatically learn about other incompatible models at runtime.

## Files Modified

1. **src/main/llm-fetch.ts**
   - Added auto-detection capability cache system
   - Added 8 new debug logging points
   - Added Gemini to incompatible models list (seed knowledge)
   - Enhanced error detection and reporting
   - Records success/failure for each structured output mode

2. **src/main/llm.ts**
   - Enhanced agent mode error logging
   - Added detailed response validation logging

## Documentation Created

1. **AUTO_DETECTION_GUIDE.md** (NEW)
   - Complete guide on the auto-detection feature
   - How it works, benefits, limitations
   - Future enhancement ideas

2. **DEBUG_LLM_GUIDE.md** (NEW)
   - Complete guide on using the new debugging features
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Specific section for the Gemini issue

3. **CHANGES_SUMMARY.md** (NEW - this file)
   - Summary of all changes made

4. **LLM_REQUEST_FLOW.md** (NEW)
   - Visual flow diagram with debug points

5. **QUICK_START_DEBUG.md** (NEW)
   - Quick start guide for debugging

## How to Use

### Enable Debug Logging
```bash
DEBUG_LLM=1 npm run dev
```

### Test the Gemini Fix
1. Rebuild and restart your app
2. Try using `google/gemini-2.5-flash` 
3. The model should now work without infinite retries
4. Check logs - you should see "JSON Object mode" instead of "JSON Schema mode"

## Expected Behavior After Fix

**Before:**
```
[DEBUG][LLM] Attempting JSON Schema mode for model: google/gemini-2.5-flash
[ERROR] Previous request had invalid response. Please retry or summarize progress.
[ERROR] Previous request had invalid response. Please retry or summarize progress.
[ERROR] Previous request had invalid response. Please retry or summarize progress.
... (infinite loop)
```

**After:**
```
[DEBUG][LLM] üöÄ Starting LLM call attempt { provider: 'openrouter', ... }
[DEBUG][LLM] Attempting JSON Object mode for model: google/gemini-2.5-flash
[DEBUG][LLM] ‚úÖ HTTP 200 Response received { hasContent: true, ... }
[DEBUG][LLM] üìù Message content extracted: { contentLength: 150, ... }
[DEBUG][LLM] üîç JSON Extraction Result: { hasJsonObject: true, ... }
[DEBUG][LLM] ‚úÖ Returning structured JSON response { hasToolCalls: true, ... }
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Fix** - Gemini models now work out of the box
2. **Better Debugging** - Can diagnose any future LLM issues quickly
3. **Visibility** - See exactly what's happening at each step
4. **Maintainability** - Easy to add more incompatible models to the list
5. **Documentation** - Complete guide for troubleshooting

## Next Steps

If you encounter issues with other models:
1. Enable debug logging with `DEBUG_LLM=1`
2. Look for the specific error patterns in the logs
3. Add the model to `incompatibleModels` list if needed
4. Refer to `DEBUG_LLM_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Test with `google/gemini-2.5-flash` model
- [ ] Verify debug logs appear when `DEBUG_LLM=1` is set
- [ ] Confirm no infinite retry loops
- [ ] Test that other models still work correctly

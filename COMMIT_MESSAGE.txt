fix: resolve OAuth state mismatch issue preventing authentication (#215)

## Problem
MCP OAuth functionality was broken in build 0.2.2 due to a critical state
mismatch issue. The OAuth flow had two conflicting code paths:

1. Manual OAuth initiation returned immediately without waiting for callbacks
2. Automatic OAuth retry started a new flow, invalidating pending flows
3. State validation failed due to mismatched state parameters

## Solution
Fixed OAuth flow orchestration to properly handle callbacks:

### Changes to src/main/mcp-service.ts
- `initiateOAuthFlow()`: Now starts callback handler and waits for callback
  in background, automatically completing the flow when callback is received
- `completeOAuthFlow()`: Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Both methods now have detailed console logging with emoji indicators

### Changes to src/main/oauth-client.ts
- `discoverServerMetadata()`: Added logging for metadata discovery
- `registerClient()`: Added logging and better error messages
- `exchangeCodeForToken()`: Added detailed logging for token exchange

### Documentation
- Created docs/oauth-fix-issue-215.md with detailed explanation
- Created ISSUE_215_SUMMARY.md with testing recommendations

## Testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ⏳ Needs testing with real OAuth MCP server
- ⏳ Needs testing in production build

## Expected Behavior
1. User clicks "Authenticate" button
2. Browser opens with OAuth authorization URL
3. User completes authorization
4. SpeakMCP automatically receives callback
5. Tokens are exchanged and saved
6. Server restarts with new tokens
7. User sees success message

## Debugging
Console logs now include:
- 🔐 Flow initiation
- 🔍 Metadata discovery
- 🔄 Client registration
- 🌐 Browser opening
- ⏳ Callback waiting
- ✓ State validation
- ✅ Success confirmation
- ❌ Error details

Fixes #215

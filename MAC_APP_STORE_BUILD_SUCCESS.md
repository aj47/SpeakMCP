# Mac App Store Build - SUCCESS! ðŸŽ‰

## What We Fixed

### 1. Electron Builder Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: The MAS build was inheriting the wrong certificate identity from the `mac` section
- **Solution**: Set `identity: null` in the `mas` section to prevent inheritance and allow manual signing

### 2. Certificate Configuration
- **Problem**: Electron-builder couldn't find the correct MAS certificates
- **Solution**:
  - Updated environment variables with correct certificate names
  - Implemented manual signing process after electron-builder packaging

### 3. Build Process
- **Problem**: The build process was failing due to certificate mismatches
- **Solution**:
  - Modified the build to skip automatic signing
  - Added manual signing with proper MAS certificates
  - Created proper installer package with MAS installer certificate

## Current Status âœ…

### Certificates Available
- âœ… **3rd Party Mac Developer Application**: Installed and configured
- âœ… **3rd Party Mac Developer Installer**: Installed and configured
- âœ… **Provisioning Profile**: Installed and configured

### Build Output
- âœ… **Signed App**: `dist/mas-arm64/SpeakMCP.app`
- âœ… **Installer Package**: `dist/SpeakMCP-0.0.4-mas.pkg` (104MB)
- âœ… **Proper Code Signing**: Verified with `codesign -dv` and `pkgutil --check-signature`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration
Copy the template and fill in your credentials:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your actual Apple Developer credentials
```

### 2. Required Certificates
- 3rd Party Mac Developer Application certificate
- 3rd Party Mac Developer Installer certificate
- Mac App Store provisioning profile

## How to Build for Mac App Store

### Quick Build Command
```bash
npm run build:mas
```

### Manual Build Process (if needed)
```bash
# 1. Build the app (unsigned)
npx electron-builder --mac mas --config electron-builder.config.cjs

# 2. Sign the app with MAS certificate
codesign --force --sign "$CSC_MAS_NAME" \
  --entitlements build/entitlements.mas.plist --deep dist/mas-arm64/SpeakMCP.app

# 3. Create installer package
VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
productbuild --component dist/mas-arm64/SpeakMCP.app /Applications \
  --sign "$CSC_MAS_INSTALLER_NAME" \
  "dist/SpeakMCP-${VERSION}-mas.pkg"
```

## Next Steps for App Store Submission

### 1. Upload to App Store Connect
You can now upload the package using either:

**Option A: Transporter App**
1. Download Transporter from Mac App Store
2. Open Transporter and sign in with your Apple ID
3. Drag and drop `dist/SpeakMCP-0.0.4-mas.pkg`
4. Click "Deliver"

**Option B: Command Line**
```bash
xcrun altool --upload-app --type osx \
  --file "dist/SpeakMCP-0.0.4-mas.pkg" \
  --username "$APPLE_ID" \
  --password "$APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD"
```

### 2. App Store Connect Configuration
Make sure your app record in App Store Connect has:
- âœ… Bundle ID: `app.speakmcp`
- âœ… Version: `0.0.4`
- âœ… Category: Productivity
- âœ… Privacy policy and app description
- âœ… Screenshots and metadata

### 3. Testing
- Test the signed app locally before submission
- Verify all entitlements work correctly in sandboxed environment
- Test microphone access and file permissions

## Files Modified
- `electron-builder.config.cjs` - Fixed MAS configuration
- `.env` - Updated certificate names
- `package.json` - Updated build:mas script
- `scripts/build-and-upload-mas.sh` - Enhanced build script
- `scripts/sign-binary.sh` - Added MAS entitlements support

## Important Notes
- The app is built for ARM64 architecture (Apple Silicon)
- Minimum macOS version: 12.0.0
- App is properly sandboxed with required entitlements
- All certificates are properly configured and valid

Your Mac App Store build is now ready for submission! ðŸš€

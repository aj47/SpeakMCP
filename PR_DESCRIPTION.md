## 🐛 **Fixes Issue #113**

Resolves the problem where MCP servers that are turned off or deleted remain visible in the tool management section, creating inconsistency between actual server state and UI representation.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. MCP Service Enhancement** (`src/main/mcp-service.ts`)
- ✅ Added `syncWithConfig()` method to clean up tools from servers no longer in configuration
- ✅ Automatically removes orphaned tools and server references
- ✅ Cleans up runtime disabled state for deleted servers
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

### **2. TIPC Endpoint** (`src/main/tipc.ts`)
- ✅ Added `syncMcpWithConfig` endpoint to expose sync functionality to renderer
- ✅ Proper error handling and response structure

### **3. Automatic Cleanup** (`src/renderer/src/components/mcp-config-manager.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated `handleDeleteServer` to call sync after server deletion
- ✅ Ensures immediate cleanup when servers are removed
- ✅ Graceful error handling that doesn't block deletion

### **4. Smart Tool Filtering** (`src/renderer/src/components/mcp-tool-manager.tsx`)
- ✅ Added server status fetching alongside tool list fetching
- ✅ Filter tools to only show those from available servers
- ✅ Available servers = not config-disabled AND runtime-enabled
- ✅ Updated empty state messaging

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Delete Server** | Tools remain visible | ✅ Tools disappear immediately |
| **Turn Off Server** | Tools remain visible | ✅ Tools disappear from list |
| **Re-enable Server** | Inconsistent state | ✅ Tools reappear when enabled |
| **Config Disable** | Tools still shown | ✅ Tools filtered out properly |

## 🚀 **Technical Benefits**

- **⚡ Immediate Sync**: No waiting for periodic refresh cycles
- **🛡️ Error Resilient**: Sync failures don't block server operations
- **🔄 Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **📊 Performance Optimized**: Minimal overhead with efficient filtering
- **🔍 Better UX**: Tool management section accurately reflects server state

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Server Deletion**: Configure server → Delete → Verify tools disappear
2. **Server Turn Off**: Configure server → Turn off → Verify tools disappear
3. **Server Re-enable**: Turn off server → Turn on → Verify tools reappear
4. **Config Disable**: Configure server → Mark disabled → Verify tools filtered

### **Validation**
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors in modified files
- ✅ Maintains existing server management functionality
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Efficient resource cleanup

## 📋 **Implementation Details**

### **Server Availability Logic**
A server is considered available if:
- Present in current configuration
- Not marked as `disabled` in config  
- Not runtime-disabled by user (`runtimeEnabled !== false`)

### **Sync Triggers**
- **Automatic**: When servers are deleted via config manager
- **Manual**: Available via TIPC endpoint for future use
- **Periodic**: Tool filtering happens every 5 seconds during normal refresh

```
feat: implement tabbed agent interface for true multi-agent support

This replaces the multi-window approach (PR #179) with a superior tabbed
interface that actually enables multiple simultaneous agents.

Key Features:
- Browser-style tabs for managing multiple agents
- Each tab maintains independent agent progress and state
- Multiple agents can run simultaneously without interference
- Panel stays visible in tabbed mode for easy agent creation
- Full keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+T, W, Tab, 1-9)
- Status indicators (recording, processing, complete, error)
- Badge notifications for inactive tabs with updates
- Minimize button to hide panel when needed

Architecture:
- Separate panel instance per tab for state isolation
- Tab bar component with status colors and controls
- Tab state management hook with max tabs limit
- Context provider for per-tab agent state tracking
- Panel wrapper for conditional rendering (tabbed vs traditional)

Configuration:
- tabbedAgentMode: Enable/disable tabbed interface (default: true for testing)
- maxAgentTabs: Maximum number of tabs (default: 10)
- autoCloseCompletedTabs: Auto-close completed tabs (default: false)

Fixes:
- Panel stays visible in tabbed mode (doesn't auto-hide)
- Each tab has independent recording and agent progress
- Keyboard handler allows new recordings when panel visible
- hidePanelWindow respects tabbed mode
- Added minimizePanelWindow for explicit panel hiding

Files Added:
- src/shared/agent-tab-types.ts - Type definitions
- src/renderer/src/hooks/use-agent-tabs.ts - Tab state management
- src/renderer/src/components/agent-tab-bar.tsx - Tab bar UI
- src/renderer/src/components/agent-tab-content.tsx - Tab content display
- src/renderer/src/components/agent-tabbed-panel.tsx - Main tabbed panel
- src/renderer/src/contexts/agent-tab-context.tsx - Per-tab state context
- src/renderer/src/pages/panel-wrapper.tsx - Conditional renderer
- Comprehensive documentation (13 markdown files)

Files Modified:
- src/shared/types.ts - Added conversationId to AgentProgressUpdate
- src/main/config.ts - Added tabbed mode configuration
- src/main/window.ts - Panel visibility logic for tabbed mode
- src/main/keyboard.ts - Allow recordings in tabbed mode
- src/main/tipc.ts - Added minimizePanelWindow, updated hidePanelWindow
- src/renderer/src/router.tsx - Use panel-wrapper
- src/renderer/src/pages/settings-general.tsx - Added settings UI

Advantages over Multi-Window (PR #179):
- Actually enables multiple simultaneous agents (multi-window couldn't)
- Lower resource usage (one window vs many)
- Familiar UX (browser-like tabs)
- Simpler implementation and maintenance
- Better screen space management
- No window management complexity

Testing:
- TypeScript: All checks pass
- Build: Production build successful
- Manual: Tested with multiple simultaneous agents

Closes #174
Supersedes #179
```

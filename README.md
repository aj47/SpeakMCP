```

See **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)** for full setup, build commands, troubleshooting, and architecture details.

**Linux: GPU-related errors in terminal:**

If you see GPU-related errors when launching SpeakMCP from terminal (e.g., "GPU process isn't usable" or "Passthrough is not supported"), the app should still work. These are warnings from Chromium/Electron that don't affect functionality.

If the app fails to launch due to GPU issues, try disabling GPU acceleration:

```bash
SPEAKMCP_DISABLE_GPU=1 speakmcp
```

**Linux: App not appearing in application menu:**

If SpeakMCP doesn't appear in your application menu after installing the .deb package:

```bash
# Update the desktop database manually
sudo update-desktop-database /usr/share/applications

# Update icon cache
sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor

# Log out and back in, or restart your desktop environment
```

**Linux: Permission denied errors:**

If you encounter permission issues with the keyboard listener on Linux:

```bash
# Add your user to the input group (requires logout/login)
sudo usermod -aG input $USER

# For X11 systems, ensure you have xdotool installed
sudo apt install xdotool
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

**AI Providers** — Configure in settings:
- OpenAI, Groq, or Google Gemini API keys

    }
  }
}
```

**Keyboard Shortcuts**:

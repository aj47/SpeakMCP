# Solution Summary: MCP Server Removal UI Sync Fix

## Problem
Issue #113: When MCP servers are turned off or deleted, they remain visible in the tool management section, creating inconsistency between actual server state and UI representation.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurred because:
1. When servers are deleted from configuration, the MCP service doesn't automatically clean up their tools
2. The tool management UI shows all tools from `getDetailedToolList()` without filtering by server availability
3. No mechanism existed to sync MCP service state with configuration changes

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Added Server-Config Synchronization
**File**: `src/main/mcp-service.ts`
- Added `syncWithConfig()` method to clean up tools from servers no longer in configuration
- Method compares current tracked servers with configured servers
- Removes orphaned tools and cleans up server references
- Handles runtime disabled state cleanup

### 2. Exposed Sync Functionality
**File**: `src/main/tipc.ts`
- Added `syncMcpWithConfig` TIPC endpoint
- Allows renderer process to trigger synchronization

### 3. Automatic Sync on Server Deletion
**File**: `src/renderer/src/components/mcp-config-manager.tsx`
- Updated `handleDeleteServer` to call sync after deletion
- Ensures immediate cleanup when servers are removed

### 4. Smart Tool Filtering
**File**: `src/renderer/src/components/mcp-tool-manager.tsx`
- Added server status fetching alongside tool list
- Filter tools to only show those from available servers
- Available = not config-disabled AND runtime-enabled

## Key Features

### Immediate Cleanup
- Tools disappear immediately when servers are deleted
- No need to wait for periodic refresh

### Proper State Management
- Only shows tools from truly available servers
- Handles both config-disabled and runtime-disabled states

### Backward Compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Existing server management continues to work

## Technical Details

### Server Availability Logic
A server is considered available if:
- Present in current configuration
- Not marked as `disabled` in config
- Not runtime-disabled by user (`runtimeEnabled !== false`)

### Sync Triggers
- Automatic: When servers are deleted via config manager
- Manual: Can be triggered via TIPC endpoint
- Periodic: Tool filtering happens every 5 seconds during normal refresh

### Error Handling
- Sync failures don't block server deletion
- Graceful fallback if sync endpoint unavailable
- Console logging for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Delete Server Test**: Configure server → Delete → Verify tools disappear
2. **Turn Off Server Test**: Configure server → Turn off → Verify tools disappear  
3. **Re-enable Server Test**: Turn off → Turn on → Verify tools reappear
4. **Config Disable Test**: Configure → Mark disabled → Verify tools disappear

## Impact
- ✅ Fixes inconsistent UI state
- ✅ Improves user experience
- ✅ Maintains performance (no additional overhead)
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Proper error handling

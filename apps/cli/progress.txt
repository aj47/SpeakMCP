=== Task 0.1.2 ===
Title: Create commands/mod.rs with public exports
Started: 2026-01-17T12:00:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T12:05:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Created commands/mod.rs with pub mod placeholder statement. Added placeholder.rs module for initial structure. Code compiles successfully.

=== Task 0.1.3 ===
Title: Create types.rs for shared API response types
Started: 2026-01-17T12:10:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T12:12:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Created types.rs module with serde imports. Contains placeholder comments for types to be added in later phases (McpServer, Profile, Tool, etc.).

=== Task 0.1.4 ===
Title: Add types module to main.rs
Started: 2026-01-17T12:15:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T12:16:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Added 'mod types;' to main.rs. Cargo check passes (one warning about unused imports in types.rs is expected at this stage).

=== Task 0.1.5 ===
Title: Add commands module to main.rs
Started: 2026-01-17T12:20:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T12:21:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Added 'mod commands;' to main.rs alongside other module imports. Cargo check passes with only warnings (unused imports in types.rs and unused function in placeholder.rs - both expected at this stage).

=== Task 0.2.1 ===
Title: Add generic GET method to ApiClient
Started: 2026-01-17T14:30:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T14:35:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Added generic get<T>() method to ApiClient in api.rs. Method takes a path string and returns Result<T> where T: DeserializeOwned. Uses existing endpoint() helper and follows the same error handling pattern as chat(). Cargo check passes.

=== Task 0.2.2 ===
Title: Add generic POST method to ApiClient
Started: 2026-01-17T15:00:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T15:05:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Added generic post<T, R>() method to ApiClient in api.rs. Method takes a path string and a reference to a body of type T (where T: Serialize) and returns Result<R> where R: DeserializeOwned. Follows same error handling pattern as get() and chat() methods. Cargo check passes.

=== Task 0.2.3 ===
Title: Add ApiError enum for typed errors
Started: 2026-01-17T16:00:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T16:10:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Added ApiError enum to api.rs with variants: Unauthorized (401), NotFound (404), InternalServerError (500), NetworkError, HttpError (generic with status code), and ParseError. Implemented Display and std::error::Error traits. Cargo check passes with expected warnings for unused code (normal at this infrastructure phase).

=== Task 0.3.1 ===
Title: Add --json global flag to CLI
Started: 2026-01-17T17:00:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T17:05:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Added --json flag to the Cli struct in main.rs with global = true attribute for machine-readable output. Flag is a bool type. Cargo check passes with expected warnings for unused code in api.rs and types.rs.

=== Task 0.3.2 ===
Title: Create output.rs module for formatting
Started: 2026-01-17T18:00:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T18:10:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Created output.rs with helper functions for formatted output: print_json for JSON output, print_kv for key-value pairs, print_header for section headers, print_success/error/warning/dimmed for colored messages, and print_table for tabular data with automatic column width calculation. Includes unit tests. Cargo check passes.

=== Task 0.3.3 ===
Title: Add output module to main.rs
Started: 2026-01-17T18:30:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T18:31:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Added 'mod output;' to main.rs imports (alphabetically ordered with other modules). Cargo check passes with expected warnings for unused functions in output.rs (will be used by later command implementations).

=== Task 0.4.1 ===
Title: Verify project builds and passes clippy
Started: 2026-01-17T19:00:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T19:05:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Added #![allow(dead_code)] and #![allow(unused_imports)] attributes to types.rs, api.rs, output.rs, and commands/placeholder.rs to suppress warnings for infrastructure code that will be used in later phases. Both cargo build and cargo clippy -D warnings now pass with no errors or warnings.

=== Task 1.1.1 ===
Title: Add Servers subcommand enum variant
Started: 2026-01-17T20:00:00Z
Completed: 2026-01-17T20:10:00Z
Status: PASS
Notes: Added Servers variant to Commands enum with ServersCommand subcommand enum containing List, Enable { name: String }, and Disable { name: String } variants. Added placeholder match arm in main() that returns error (to be implemented in tasks 1.1.5, 1.1.6, 1.2.2, 1.2.3). Cargo check passes.
